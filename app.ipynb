When you paste this into a new `.ipynb` file, each `# Cell` markdown heading will denote a new cell in the notebook. The Python code between the triple backticks (```) should be pasted into the corresponding cell.

Please note, however, that this might not work directly by copying and pasting. The `.ipynb` file format is a JSON-based format that includes additional metadata for each cell, and isn't designed to be created manually.

It would be much easier and more reliable to create a new Jupyter Notebook using the Jupyter Notebook interface, and then copy and paste the Python code into the cells of the notebook.
